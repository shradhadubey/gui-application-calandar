# GUI application for Calendar with Python using Tkinter

In Python, we can make GUIs using Tkinter. If you are very imaginative and creative you can do amazing stuff with Tkinter. Here, we will make a Python Calendar GUI application using Tkinter. In this app, the user has to enter the year for which he wants to view the calendar, and then the calendar will appear.

Install Tkinter first using this command: pip install tk

We would also need a Calendar package, but we donâ€™t have to install it. It is a default package that automatically comes with python.
